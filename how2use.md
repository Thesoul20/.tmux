when install the fork repo in https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git . you should first rename the core file of .tmux.conf and .tmux.conf.local to the name without `.` .

And then move this repo to the correct path such as ~ and  ~/.config/tmux .

At least run the command to source the configures as `tmux source ~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` .
